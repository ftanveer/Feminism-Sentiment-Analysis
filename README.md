# Sentiment-Analysis
PROJECT FILE: Female Reboot vs Non_Reboot 2.ipynb


## CONTEXT: 
The audience for movies and TV shows has become somewhat of a landmine when it comes to casting.

Hollywood has been churning out multiple inclusive films that have been known to make headlines for their either lack of inclusivity or too much inclusivity. The topic is a complicated one as social media is strongly divided on this matter.

Many films which originally had a lead cast of men had been rebooted to a female led movie and most of these films have been negatively received. Social media argues it is poor writing and that movies studios are jumping on the feminism bandwagon and others say the audience just doesn't like the idea of female led movies.

## GOAL OF PROJECT:
We want to observe movies with original plot with a female led cast vs movies which were previously male led cast but was rebooted to a female led cast.
Let us use sentiment analysis to observe if most of the negative feedback from the female reboots are due to audience complaining about feminism and its influence on these films.

## HOW TO RUN:
The notebooks can be run in Jupiter notebooks or any other IDE which supports ipython files.

## METHOD USED:
Vector similarity was used to find negative reviews with feminism key words and compare the negative feminism score between the different film types.

## CONCLUSION:
Using a null hypothesis that both film types have same negative feminism score we perform a T-test.

So the probability of obtaining the measured differences between reboot and original films is very low (1.8%), lower than our 5% hence we can say with 95% confidence that the reboot films do indeed generate more negative reviews that are associated with feminism concepts.

So the audience has more negative sentiment by reboot films due to the feminism woke culture in films. This occurs primarily as the audience have been familiar with the films initially cast with male led casts.

Unfortunately Hollywood will not stop such a business model as regardless it still makes them money, the best way to push feminism forward is to bring about orginal story films with female led cast resulting in less backlash and a fresh new film for the people to enjoy.
